EECS481 and EECS100 Group Sorting Hat

The Group Sorting Hat allows faculty of group-based courses to easily sort their students into proposal based groups by, score, preference, or gender.

Potential Workflow for Sorting 

If you wish to sort by gender:

    1) Select: Sort women into Top choices in the Class Sort Menu
    2) Alter students to your liking
    3) Select: Lock women in the Group Sort Menu
Otherwise, 

    1) Select: Sort Students into Top Preference in the Class Sort Menu
    2) Press the Add/Remove buttons for a group to achieve the desired sizes. If score is on, this will remove the student with the lowest score.
        a)Note: "Sort Students in 2nd Choice" is automatically selected, but if a group cannot be add/remove any members, check "Sort Students in 3rd Choice" in the Group Sort Menu
    3) If you are manually moving students (by drag and drop) and using Add/Remove buttons, remember to select "Sort Groups by Score" to reorder students.
    4) At anytime, you can lock presenters and their teammate preferences under the Group Sort Menu, and they will not be Added/Removed.
